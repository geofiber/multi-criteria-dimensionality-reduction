This folder contains the Multiplicative Weight Update (MW) and Frank-Wolfe algorithms for solving SDP relaxation of multi-criteria dimensionality reduction.

The algorithms are implemented as methods in optimizer.py. 
The file heurisitcs.ipynb can be viewed as an example of how to instantiate these heuristics.
However, the 1940 Colorado Census Data (row and preprocessed) used in the experiments are not included due to its size. 
Therefore, running heurisitcs.ipynb as is will cause an error.
The user should replace the data matrices used by the data matrices of interests.
